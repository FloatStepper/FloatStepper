Non-zero Centre of mass-Centre of rotation displacement test

Test of rigid body motion solution with body coordinate system centre of
rotation chosen at (x, y) = (0, 1) and with centre of mass at (x, y) = (0, 0).
Body is an ellipse and has density VERY much larger than fluid so fluid force
should have no effect at all.
Body started with vx = 1, vy = 0 and omega = 1 for the centre of mass which
amounts to zero velocity of geometric centre, which accelerates with (0,-1)
m/s^2.

Inspection of body motion with paraview and plotting of coordinates with
plotCoordinates.py confirm essentially constant CoM motion produced by the
oscillating centre of rotation motion.
