_________________________ FLOATSTEPPER ____________________________

Library for rigid body interaction with two phase flow.
May also be used in single phase mode by setting alpha field to 1.

Solver
floatStepper

Library
floaterMotion (code structure based on sixDoFRigidBodyMotion)

Requirements
OpenFOAM-v2206 (may compile with later versions as well).

Installation
1. Source OpenFOAM-v2206
2. Execute ./Allwmake from FloatStepper main directory

Testing
Execute ./Allrun in run/flatLightBoxInWaves

Note that case syntax in slightly different from sixDoFRigidBodyMotion cases.
In particular:
0.  Set application to floatStepper in system/controlDict.
1.  Use dynamicFloaterMotionSolversFvMesh in constant/dynamicMeshDict.
    See examples of usage in run/*/constant/dynamicMeshDict.
2.  Use floaterVelocity for U on floating object patches.
    Set "slip true;" to run with slip boundary condition (default is no-slip).

Known limitations
-   Currently only runs with morphing mesh (not overset mesh)
-   Has not been tested with turbulence modelling.
-   Currently only runs with isoAdvector (not MULES).
-   Plenty of field copying that can probably be avoided to increase efficiency.
