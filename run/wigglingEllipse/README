This bencmark case is used in Section 5.3 of "A robust algorithm for
computational floating body dynamics" to validate the hydrodynamic coupling of
translational and rotational degrees of freedom via added mass coefficients.

The body is an ellipse in a 2D inviscid fluid with boundaries very far away.
In the limit of an infinite fluid, the Kirchhoff-Kelvin ODE equations can be
numerically integrated to get exact solution for the body trajectory.
The ellipse shape is controlled by the parameters R and a in the bodyDict file,
via the Joukowski transformation,

z = R(zeta + a^2/zeta)

where zeta = exp(i*theta), theta = [0,2pi], so a = 0 corresponds to a circle of
radius R, a = 1 corresponds to a plate of length 2R and values inbetwee
correspond to ellipses of various eccentricity.

The bodyDict file is also used to specify the initial position and velocity of
the ellipse. This file is also read by KirchhoffKelvinIntegrator2D to produce
the theoretical orbit.

By default the elliptic body has a = 0.5 and is started at the origin with its
major axis along the y-axis, vx = 1, vy = 0 and omega = 1.
This gives rise to steady motion along the x-axis superimposed with angular
wiggling and wobbling.

For Kirchhoff-Kelvin equations, see e.g. Milne-Thomson's Theoretical
Hydrodynamics.

Note that the finest cases generated with the nxMaxCoScanner script take a VERY
long time to run.
